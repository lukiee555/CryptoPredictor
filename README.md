# Udacity MLND Capstone

Capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree

## Problem Statement

The overall goal of the project is to construct a machine
learning model that can predict price trends with results
superior to that of random selection. As the cryptocurrency has
a reputation of being a very speculative investment, driven to a
high a degree by the emotional frenzy of amateur investors, we
will attempt to discern what impact this has on the market by
incorporating various different features and the impact on
performance.
